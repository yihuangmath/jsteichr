    <h4>Shape of Thurston's filling systole subset in surface moduli space</h4>

    <p>In this talk, I am going to talk about the sparseness of Thurston's subset. Sparseness is a geometric concept on Thurston's subset firstly raised by Anderson-Parlier-Pettet in 2016. We have proved the sparseness of Thurston's subset in the sense of  Teichm\"uller distance and Weil-Petersson distance. More precisely, most surfaces in genus g surface moduli space have Teichm&#252;ller distance \(\frac{1}{5}\log\log g\)  and Weil-Petersson distance \(0.6521(\sqrt{\log g}-\sqrt{7\log\log g})\) to the Thurston's subset. Some recent progresses on random surface (Mirzakhani-Petri, Nie-Wu-Xue) and estimate of the Weil-Petersson distance by systole (Wu) are important tools in our proof.</p>

    <p>Teichm&#252;ller space admits several ray structures. In this talk, we first depict harmonic map ray structures on Teichm&#252;ller space as a geometric transition between Teichm&#252;ller ray structures and Thurston geodesic ray structures. In particular, by appropriately degenerating the source of a harmonic map between hyperbolic surfaces (along "harmonic map dual rays"), the harmonic map rays through the target converge to a Thurston geodesic; by appropriately degenerating the target of the harmonic map, those harmonic map dual rays through the domain converge to Teichm&#252;ller geodesics. While there may be many Thurston metric geodesics between a pair of points in Teichm&#252;ller space, we find that by imposing an additional energy minimization constraint on the geodesics, thought of as limits of harmonic map rays, we select a unique Thurston geodesic through those points. Extending the target surface to the Thurston boundary yields, for each point Y in Teichm&#252;ller space, we construct an "exponential map" of rays from that point Y onto Teichm&#252;ller space with visual boundary the Thurston boundary of Teichm&#252;ller space. This is a joint work with Michael Wolf  (arXiv:2206.01371).</p>

    <p>In this talk, I will survey what is known or conjectured about maps between configuration spaces and moduli spaces of surfaces. Among them, we consider two categories: continuous maps and also holomorphic maps. We will also talk about some results and conjectures about maps between finite covers of those spaces. Unlike the case of the whole spaces, much less is known about their finite covers.</p>

    <p>The universality of Brownian motion underlies the appearance of SLE in conformally invariant 2D systems. The action functional of Brownian motion, namely the Dirichlet energy, corresponds to the Loewner energy for a Jordan curve. This energy, intuitively speaking, measures the roundness of a Jordan curve and the density of SLE around the curve. Furthermore, this energy is shown by Takhtajan and Teo to be a Kahler potential on the space of Weil-Petersson quasicircles, identified with the Weil-Petersson universal Teichm&uuml;ller space. I will overview different geometric and probabilistic descriptions of the Loewner energy and Weil-Petersson Teichm&uuml;ller space and discuss further development by exploring those links.</p>

    <p>I will talk about mapping class group action on the curve complex with the following  conjecture in mind: an element with small stable translation length is a normal generator. This conjecture is motivated by a similar statement in the case of the action on the Teichm&#252;ller space proved by Lanier-Margalit. I will discuss various partial results (based on joint works with various subsets of \(\{\)Dongryul Kim, Hyunshik Shin, Philippe Tranchida, Chenxi Wu\(\}\)).</p>

    <p>Spacelike minimal surfaces in the pseudo-hyperbolic (2+q)-spacetime are actually maximal and are related to \(\mathrm{SO}\)(2,q+1)-representations of surface groups through the works of Bonsante-Schlenker and Collier-Tholozan-Toulisse. We investigate a type of minimal surface associated to \(\mathrm{SO}\)(n,n+1)-representations. They occur in pseudo-hyperbolic spacetimes with higher space dimensions, and hence are not maximal; but they are still infinitesimally rigid, hence can be used to prove Labourie's conjecture in rank \(2\).</p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.math.ens.psl.eu/~tholozan/">Nicolas THOLOZAN</a> (&Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure), 2022-09-05, Compact quotients of homogeneous spaces</h4>

    <p>Let \(G\) be a Lie group acting transitively on a manifold \(X\). A <em>compact quotient of \(X\)</em> (also called <em>compact Clifford--Klein form</em>) is simply a quotient of \(X\) by a discrete subgroup of \(G\) acting properly discontinuously and cocompactly. In this talk, we will address the following questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Does \(X\) admit compact quotients?</li>
            <li>If so, what is their topology?</li>
            <li>If so, do these compact quotients have deformations?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    These questions are rooted in the mathematics of the late XIX<sup>th</sup> century: Klein's <em>Erlangen program</em>, the uniformization of (closed) Riemann surfaces, Poincar&eacute;'s <em>Analysis Situs</em>...
